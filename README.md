The Google Developer Student Club (GDSC) is a community group for college and university students interested in Google developer technologies. We welcome students from all undergraduate and graduate programs who are interested in growing as developers. Students who join GDSCs grow their knowledge in a peer-to-peer learning environment and build solutions for local businesses.
